# BIO6
Co-create an Intelligent Myoelectric Prosthesis (IMP)

BIO6 is a startup project which goal is to help people with disabilities like amputed limbs get a better quality life and unleash their full potential. 

At first, our project target transhumeral and transradial amputees. So, our main project is to build a myoelectric hand prosthesis helped with AI software alogoryhtm that can recognize object forms with tons of sensors, and adjust hand position to have the best grasp over all kind of ojbects.  Once those different objects identified and the AI learned how to best perform at taking it, the path will be stored on the cloud to help other prosthesis users acknowledge it.


Notes: 
- Project will be build on Raspberry Pi and coded with Python


Hardware :
- Gyroscopic
- Infrared camera module sensor




The main task to be programmed is :
1. Shape detection algorythm
2. AI body positioning spacial representation
3.
